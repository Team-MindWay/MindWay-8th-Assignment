    HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard
    markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript,
    HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually
    engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces
    for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML files and render
    them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
    website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup
    language, rather than a programming language.<br /><br /><br />

    HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images
    and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It
    provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
    semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
    other items.<br /><br /><br />

    The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags
    enclosed in angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags and
    scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page<br /><br /><br />
